                <p><strong>What Is It</strong> 3D Printing turns 3D models into solid objects by building them in layers.</p>
                <p><strong style="text-align: center">How It Works</strong> 3D printers print like blueprints. To create a 3D object, you have to start with a virtual design of the object through a CAD file. A CAD file is created using a 3D modeling application or a 3D scanner.</p>
                <p><strong style="text-align: center">History</strong> In 1983, Chuck Hall created the 3D printing process called stereolithography. Therefore, despite 3D printing being a "futuristic" concept, it has been around for more than 30 years. 3D printing received all of its attention in 2009. Before 2009, 3D printing was mostly limited to industrial use, but through a project with RepRap, the first 3D printer was born. This computer was able to be create because patents were starting to expire.</p>

                While 3D Printing has its disadvatanges, such as 
                <ul>Higher cost for large productions runs</ul>
                <ul>Limited strength and endurance</ul>
                <ul>Lower precision</ul>
                The advantages out-weight the disadvantages. Based on the article, some of the advantages include:
                <ul>Ability to create complex designs</ul>
                <ul>Ability to customize each and every item</ul>
                <ul>Speed and ease of protyping, faster and less risky route to market</ul>
                Therefore, as a college student, I believe that 3D is a groundbreaking and innovative concept in the Computer Science industry. 
                One of the biggest ways 3D printing has been beneficial to the medical field as well due to its ability to create body parts that people may have lost or been born without.
