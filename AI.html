            Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, is a rapidly growing sub-field in Computer Science. The goal of AIs is for the machines to
            perform tasks and build systems that model human thinking.

            <p>Of course, there are many people that are afraid of the potential that machines can develop. Agreeably, there
            are notable scientists that have responded with the their thoughts on how Artificial Intelligence can be a scary development to the human race.</p>
            <p><i>The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.... It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are
                limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.</i> -Stephen Hawking</p>
